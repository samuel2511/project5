# CLIENT-SERVER ARCHITECTURE WITH MYSQL 

In a client-server architecture, a client is a computer or device that sends a request to a server, and the server is a computer or device that receives the request and performs some action in response to it. In the context of MySQL, the client is typically a program that sends SQL statements to the server, and the server is a MySQL database server that processes the SQL statements and returns the results to the client.

The client-server architecture offers several benefits, including:

Separation of responsibilities: The client is responsible for sending requests and displaying results, while the server is responsible for storing and processing data. This separation allows each component to focus on its specific tasks, which can lead to more efficient and scalable systems.
